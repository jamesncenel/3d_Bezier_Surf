# 3d_Bezier_Surf
Here's a Mathematica notebook that demonstrates the creation of 3D Bezier surfaces through the interpolation of interior points through the coons method. You can only run this if you have Mathematica. Download the notebook, open it in Mathematica, and then run it with Shift + Enter within the main code block.

Note: You can only have one notebook open at a time in Mathematica. If you have more than one open at once, it may cause errors when executing any of them.
